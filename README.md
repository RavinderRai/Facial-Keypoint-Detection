# Facial-Keypoint-Detection

Using OpenCV and deep learning we can implement an algorithm to detect key facial features of people's faces. 
In this project we do exactly that, by detecting features such as the edge of the face, eyes, and nose by putting dots arouund these features.

## Python Libraries required
Standard python libraries such as numpy and matplotlib will be needed, as well as OpenCV, torch, os, pandas, glob, and torchvision.

### Installation
To install any library, just use the pip install function, for example:
$ pip install Pillow

This will work for windows, mac and linux. For othe libraries, replace 'Pillow' with the name of the other library to be download.
